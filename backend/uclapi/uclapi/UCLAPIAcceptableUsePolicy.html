<h1>UCL API Acceptable Use Policy</h1>
<h2>Acceptance of Terms</h2>
<p>This UCL API Terms of Service document (the “API Terms of Service”) is an agreement you must accept in order to use the UCL API (as described below). This document describes both your rights and your obligations as part of using the UCL API. It is important that you read it carefully because you will be legally bound to these terms. UCL API (“UCL API” “we” “us”) only provide the UCL API to you subject to this API Terms of Service. By accepting the API Terms of Service or by accessing or using the UCL API, you agree to be bound by this API Terms of Service.<p>
<p>
If you are entering into the API Terms of Service on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to this API Terms of Service. In that case, the terms “you” or “your” shall also refer to such entity. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with the API Terms of Service, you may not use the UCL API. You acknowledge that the API Terms of Service is a contract between you and UCL API, even though it is electronic and is not physically signed by you and UCL API, and it governs your use of the UCL API.
</p>
<h2>
Rate Limits. 
</h2>
<p>
You will not attempt to exceed or circumvent limitations on access, calls and use of the UCL API ("Rate Limits"), or otherwise use the UCL API in a manner that exceeds reasonable request volume, constitutes excessive or abusive usage, or otherwise fails to comply or is inconsistent with any part of this Agreement. If you exceed or UCL API reasonably believes that you have attempted to circumvent Rate Limits, controls to limit use of the UCL APIs or the terms and conditions of this Agreement, then your ability to use the Licensed Materials may be temporarily suspended or permanently blocked. UCL API may monitor your use of the UCL API to improve the UCL API Service and to ensure your compliance with this Agreement.
</p>
<h2>
Communication
</h2>
<p>
You agree to periodical service, update and/or maintenance emails being sent to your UCL email address. These are essential to keeping you informed about the API, updates to it, breaking changes and security action points that must be communicated in a timely manner. If you do not agree to these service emails, you should not agree to using this API.
</p>
<h2>
Use of APIs and UCL Data
</h2>
<p>
The following identifies limitations on use related to the UCL API:
</p>

<h3>
Reliance on API
</h3>
<p>
The API is still evolving, and we need the flexibility to occasionally make changes to our APIs, including backwards incompatible ones. We will try to give notice of these changes, but you should follow the @uclapi Twitter account for updates. Also, parts of our API are undocumented, including certain methods, events, and properties. Given that these undocumented aspects of our API may change at any time, you should not rely on these behaviors.
</p>
<h3>
Applicable laws or agreements
</h3>
<p>
You may not use the UCL API in violation of any law or regulation, or rights of any person, including but not limited to intellectual property rights, rights of privacy, or rights of personality, or in any manner inconsistent with this API Terms of Service or UCL API’s other agreements to which you are subject.
</p>
<h3>
Scope of acceptable use
</h3>
<p>
You may not use the UCL API or any other technology in a manner that accesses or uses any information beyond what UCL API allows under this API Terms of Service or the Documentation; that changes the UCL API Service; that breaks or circumvents any of UCL API’s technical, administrative, process or security measures; that disrupts or degrades the performance of the UCL API Service; or that tests the vulnerability of UCL API’s systems or networks.
</p>
<h3>
Malware
</h3>
<p>
You may not transmit any viruses or other computer programming that may damage, detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept, or expropriate any system or data.
</p>

<p>
You may not distribute or allow access to the UCL APIs to anyone other than yourself. Anyone who wants to access the UCL API must agree to be bound by this policy.
